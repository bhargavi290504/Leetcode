Let's perform a dry run of the provided code with the input nums = [23, 2, 4, 6, 7] and k = 6.
​
Initialization
unordered_map<int, int> mp initialized with mp[0] = -1 to handle edge cases.
sum = 0
Iteration
Iteration 1 (i = 0)
sum += nums[0] → sum = 23
remainder = sum % k → remainder = 23 % 6 = 5
remainder is not in mp, so we add mp[5] = 0
Iteration 2 (i = 1)
sum += nums[1] → sum = 23 + 2 = 25
remainder = sum % k → remainder = 25 % 6 = 1
remainder is not in mp, so we add mp[1] = 1
Iteration 3 (i = 2)
sum += nums[2] → sum = 25 + 4 = 29
remainder = sum % k → remainder = 29 % 6 = 5
remainder is in mp and i - mp[5] > 1 → 2 - 0 > 1 is true, so we return true.
Conclusion
We found a subarray [2, 4] (indices 1 to 2) whose sum is 6, which is a multiple of k. Hence, the output is true.
Thus, the dry run shows that the function correctly identifies the subarray [2, 4] with sum equal to 6, which is a multiple of k = 6, and returns true.
